# Trending YouTube Video Statistics 

## Project Title 

US YouTube Trending Video Analysis

## Description

This project explores trends in US YouTube videos using the USvideos.csv dataset from Kaggle.

Our goal is to analyze YouTube trending videos in order to identify patterns and factors that influence a video's likelihood to trend and its engagement performance, helping content creators optimize their strategies for better visibility and audience reach.

## Dataset-

Source: Kaggle – YouTube Trending Video Dataset

File Used: USvideos.csv

Details: Contains data on daily trending YouTube videos in the US from 2017-2018. Each row represents a video trending on a specific date, including metadata like views, likes, comments, publish date, category, and more.

## Analysis-
We addressed several key questions:
1.	Which video categories trend the most frequently?
2.	Which categories get the highest engagement (likes, comments, views)?
3.	Which categories get the lowest engagement (likes, comments, views)?
4.	Do certain publishing days or times lead to better trending performance?
5.	Which channels trend the most — and what do they have in common?
6.	What are the most common tags or keywords among trending videos?
7.	How long does it typically take for a video to become trending after being published?
8.	What is the correlation between likes and views?
