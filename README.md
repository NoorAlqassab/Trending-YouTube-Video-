# Trending YouTube Video Statistics 

## Project Title 

Breaking USA YouTube Algorithm:Insights into Trending Videos and Engagement.

## Description
This project explores trends in US YouTube videos using the USvideos.csv dataset from Kaggle.
Our goal is to analyze video categories, engagement metrics (views, likes, comments), and other factors that influence which videos trend in the US.



## Dataset

Source: Kaggle – YouTube Trending Video Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new/data?select=USvideos.csv

File Used: USvideos.csv

Details: Contains data on daily trending YouTube videos in the US from 2017-2018. Each row represents a video trending on a specific date, including metadata like views, likes, comments, publish date, category, and more.

## Analysis
We addressed several key questions:
1.	Which video categories trend the most frequently?
2.	Which categories get the highest/lowest engagement (likes, comments, views)?
3.	Do certain publishing days or times lead to better trending performance?
4.	Which channels trend the most — and what do they have in common?
5.	What are the most common tags or keywords among trending videos?
6.	How long does it typically take for a video to become trending after being published?



## Conclution

•	Entertainment and Music categories are more likely to trend than News or Education.

•	Videos with more tags or certain keywords tend to trend more.

•	Videos published on Thursday and Fridays get more engagement.


## Dependencies
